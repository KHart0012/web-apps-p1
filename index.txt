Kevin - 1

I am currently a senior working towards finishing my degree in computer science. 

I am from Kansas City, the Missouri side, and I went the North Kansas City High School in Northtown. My experience of programming has come from doing fun side projects and studying on my own. I am also a TA for the school of computer science and I am a TA for Data Structures and I am the only TA for Operating Systems. I really enjoy playing video games on my computer at home, and I have tried to make multiple games either with a group of friends or on my own. 

Currently my plan is to get a doctorate in computer science in a specialized field of computer science (I currently haven't decided what specialization I want to pursue). I am taking different classes that I would normally not take so that I can broaden my horizons and see what might interest me.
