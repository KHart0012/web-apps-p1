## About
The purpose of this repository is tell you about myself and some tools that I used to make this into a GtiHub Pages Website.

## Recommended Tools
Some tools that I would recommend would be a browser that you enjoy, I personally enjoy Google Chrome, a text editor like Visual Studio code, or notepad++, and a GitHub account. Links to all of those are listed below. To publish to GitHub Pages, you will need to know markdown which is a very easy to learn markup language.
  - Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/
  - Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  - GitHub: https://github.com

## Recommended Resources
As I am not a web developer I have not amassed a list of resources over my years in computer science. I have looked around at some good resources that might be useful to someone who is looking to get into the field. These include:

  - https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
  - https://stackoverflow.com/
  - https://code.tutsplus.com/

Stack Overflow is not specifically for web development, but it can help you answer many of your questions that you might have about it.
