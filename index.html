            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a senior working towards finishing my degree in computer science.

            <h2>Current</h2>
            <p>
                I am from Kansas City, the Missouri side, and I went the North Kansas City High School in Northtown.
                My experience of programming has come from doing fun side projects and studying on my own.
                I am also a TA for the school of computer science and I am a TA for Data Structures and I am the only
                TA for Operating Systems. I really enjoy playing video games on my computer at home, and I have tried to
                make multiple games either with a group of friends or on my own.

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>
                Currently my plan is to get a doctorate in computer science in a specialized field of computer science
                (I currently haven't decided what specialization I want to pursue). I am taking different classes that I
                would normally not take so that I can broaden my horizons and see what might interest me.
